Description: Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has successfully been used to identify single-nucleotide variants (SNV), small insertions and deletions (INDELs) and, more recently, small copy number variants (CNVs). However, due to utilization of short reads, it is not well suited for identification of structural variants (SV). Optical mapping (OM) from Bionano Genomics, utilizes long fluorescently labeled megabase size DNA molecules for de novo genome assembly and identification of SVs with a much higher sensitivity than WGS. Nevertheless, currently available SV annotation tools have limited number of functions. NanotatoR is an R package written to provide a set of annotations for SVs identified by OM. It uses Database of Genomic Variants (DGV), Database of Chromosomal Imbalance and Phenotype in Humans Using Ensembl Resources (DECIPHER) as well as a subset (154 samples) of 1000 Genome Project to calculate the population frequencies of the SVs (an optional internal cohort SV frequency calculation is also available). NanotatoR creates a primary gene list (PG) from NCBI databases based on proband’s phenotype specific keywords and compares the list to the set of genes overlapping/near SVs. The output is given in an Excel file format, which is subdivided into multiple sheets based on SV type (e.g., INDELs, Inversions, Translocations). Users then have a choice to filter SVs using the provided annotations for de novo (if parental samples are available) or inherited rare variants.

Description: Next-generation mapping (NGM) from Bionano Genomics, utilizes long fluorescently labeled native-state DNA molecules for de novo genome assembly to overcome the limitations of WGS. NGM allows for a significant increase in SV detection capability. However, similar to SNVs, accuracy of SV annotation is highly important for variant classification and filtration to determine pathogenicity.    
    Here we create a new tool for SV annotation including population frequency and gene function and expression using publicly available datasets.We use DGV (Database of Genomic Variants), which contains SVs from 7965 individuals to calculate the population frequency of the SVs identified by the Bionano SVCaller in the NGM dataset of a cohort of 50 undiagnosed patients with a variety of phenotypes. The new annotation tool, nanotatoR, also calculates the internal frequency of SVs, which could be beneficial in identification of potential false positive or common calls. The software creates a primary gene list (PG) from NCBI databases based on patient phenotype and compares the list to the set of genes overlapping the patient’s SVs generated by the SVCaller, providing  analysts with an easy way to identify variants affecting genes  in the PG. The output is given in an Excel file format, which is subdivided into multiple sheets based on SV type. Users then have a choice to filter SVs using the provided annotation for identification of inherited, de novo or rare variants. Visualization options are available for distribution of the different SV types and size ranges. An option is also available to add the read counts from RNASeq data, to the annotated SVs called by Bionano SVCaller, to observe whether there is a change in expression due to the change in the structure.    
	nannotator provides integrated annotation and the expression patterns to enable users to identify potential pathogenic SVs with greater precision and faster turnaround times.
